I occasionally need to reinstall my workspace and this process needs to be repeatable.
Using https://nixos.org/[Nix] is the most repeatable way I have found so far.

This repository is organized over three main topics:

* obtaining an install media which fits my needs
* having all my hosts configurations under version control
* having my user environment under version control

== Install media

The installation media is designed to install NixOS on standard x86_64 laptops.

The whole process has xref:install-media.adoc[its own specific documentation].

== Hosts configurations

Hosts configurations are flake based and can be installed with both `nixos-install --flake` (install media) and `nixos-rebuild switch --flake`.

The available hosts are:

* `testbox`: mainly used to test the installation media
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Kusanagi[`kusanagi`]: to test my custom environment in a virtual machine

== User environment

I rely on https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager[Home Manager] to deploy my user environment.

As `home-manager` also supports a `--flake` option to install flake based user environments, this repository's flake provides:

TODO: Add user environment to flake.
