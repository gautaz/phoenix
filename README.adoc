I occasionally need to reinstall my workspace and this process needs to be repeatable.
Using https://nixos.org/[Nix] is the most repeatable way I have found so far.

This repository is organized over three main topics:

* obtaining an install media which fits my needs
* having all my hosts configurations under version control
* having my user environment under version control

== Installation media

The installation media is designed to install NixOS on standard x86_64 laptops.

The whole process has xref:install-media.adoc[its own specific documentation].

== Install process

Most of the install process is detailed in the installation media documentation.

Nevertheless some additional tasks are needed:

* the `del` user password is `password` by default and need to be changed on the first boot
* the host ssh public key needs to be added to this repository:
** on a platform allowed to modify the repository, retrieve the file `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub` from the new host
** compute the host https://github.com/FiloSottile/age[`age`] key from the ssh public key with https://github.com/Mic92/ssh-to-age[`ssh-to-age`]: `ssh-to-age -i <path/to/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub>`
** add the `age` key to the link:./.sops.yaml[repository SOPS keys]
** update the keys of the link:./hosts/_/sops.yaml[SOPS managed secrets file]: `+sops updatekeys <repository root>/hosts/_/sops.yaml+`
** commit and push these modifications
* pass on the modifications to the new host and initialize the user environment:
** `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:gautaz/phoenix`
** `home-manager switch --flake github:gautaz/phoenix`
** `passage-bootstrap`

== Hosts configurations

Hosts configurations are flake based and can be installed with both `nixos-install --flake` (from the installation media environment) and `nixos-rebuild switch --flake`.

The available hosts are:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard[`abelard`]: current work dell laptop
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri[`dante`]: former work dell laptop
* https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Moine_fou[`hepao`]: my https://frame.work/[framework] laptop
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Kusanagi[`kusanagi`]: to test my custom environment in a virtual machine
* `testbox`: mainly used to test the installation media

== User environment

I rely on the https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-install-standalone[standalone installation] of https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager[Home Manager] to deploy my user environment.
The reason why I do not use Home Manager as a NixOS module is because I want to be able to use it even when I cannot choose NixOS as my operating system.

As `home-manager` also supports a `--flake` option to install flake based user environments, this repository's flake provides a home environment for my main and only account (`del`).
